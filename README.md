## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[My friends who is also applying to this intern explaining to me what is going on behind each functions, and the website W3school
to help me understand all the HTML syntax]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Challenges I encountered in creating this submission was that I not familiar with Js, HTML, and CSS, so I need to read all of the
requirements carfuly and understand what each means. For example in the HTML file at first I dont know any of the syntax, so I went
searching up what each stntax is and came across this wesite W3school that helped me understand all the HTML syntax. Following that in
JS file the syntax is a bit different from C++, the language that I am used to, so i had some trouble writing it and understand what
each function is going on, therefore, I asked one of my friend who knows HTML and JS to explain me what each function do. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[A question I have after completeing my submission is that, I wonder how the web developer at Apple created a web page that is so
astounding, with every scroll the web page changes what we are viewing grabing our attention and putting it on what they wanted us
to foucs on. Every scroll is different from every aspect of the Iphone they try to sell us to a zooming of an amazing picture that 
the phone can capture.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I might spend time in adding a function that increase the difficulty of the game.
From making the patterns longer and increase the speed between the light up of each button at a more difficult level to maybe add 
in more buttons to the game. Also I would like to maybe add a score system to the game that tracks the highest level the player get
to.]
